        <h1 class="unnumbered" id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
        <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has emerged as a
        critical sensoral component in the production of autonomous vehicle
        perception and navigation systems. LiDAR works by utilizing pulses of
        electromagnetic waves to gather vital data on the distance from the
        sensoral component and nearby objects. This research aims to
        comprehensively evaluate the implications of LiDAR technology for
        autonomous 4-wheeler driving. By analyzing the technical capabilities
        and limitations of various LiDAR systems through conducting an effective
        meta-analysis, this study analyses the potential implications of this
        technology and autonomous vehicles in general. Additionally, the
        computational demands, software algorithms, and infrastructure
        requirements for processing large LiDAR datasets in real-time are
        investigated. This work also examines the safety implications of LiDAR
        and Autonomous Vehicles, including potential failures, sensor redundancy
        needs, and verification and validation processes. The long-term
        scalability and cost factors that may impact mainstream LiDAR adoption
        are also taken into account. Overall, this multifaceted research aims to
        provide a comprehensive perspective on the current state and future
        prospects of LiDAR technology for enabling safe and reliable autonomous
        driving capabilities.</p>
        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>Autonomous Vehicles(which is frequently refered to as "AV" or "AVs"
        further throughout in this article) have been subject to multi-faceted
        research fronts, with a sharp rise in the intensity of research on the
        topic in recent years. AVs promise to revolutionize personalized
        transport through safer, cleaner, more convenient mode of
        transportation. However, a essential component of AVs needs to be
        created and tested in real-world scenarios before production, which is
        the distance sensor system. This is crucial in AVs as they allow the
        computer to gauge the distance from surrounding traffic, pedestrians,
        and understand lane zoning of roads, etc. A potential solution, which
        will be covered in this article, is LiDAR, also known as Light Detection
        and ranging. LiDAR uses electromagnetic waves to guage distances with
        exceptional accuracy and in multiple weather conditions<span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="synopsysWhatLiDAR mrlcgLiDARCars"></span>.</p>
        <p>However, LiDAR is not the only solution to this problem. Some of
        these are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Advanced Camera Systems. These systems use cameras and computer
        vision algorithms for object recognition. However, these suffer in poor
        lighting conditions<span class="citation"
        data-cites="dorlecoBestSensors"></span>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Radar. Radar is a similar system that gives the direction of
        movement and location of a object. However, it does provide as much
        accuracy as LiDAR<span class="citation"
        data-cites="dorlecoBestSensors"></span>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Hybrid. Hybrid systems use a mix of LiDAR, Cameras, and Radar to
        create a more accurate picture and provide more details basing of the
        use cases of each. However, such systems would prove to be quite
        expensive.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="connection-to-soi">Connection to SOI</h2>
        <p>LiDAR Based Autonomous vehicles are connected to the statement of
        inquiry "Wave theory demonstrates the interaction of energy with the
        environment through modelling a law of the natural world", as LiDAR
        works on the principles of wave-theory. LiDAR based Autonomous Vehicles
        use wave theory, as it utilizes the reflection of light waves to measure
        distance of an object from the sensor.</p>
        <h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
        <p>LiDAR(short for Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing
        method that utilizes electromagnetic pulses to calculate the
        ranges(variable distance from the device). Usually, this is paired with
        other data to create a accurate 3D model of the environment. A LiDAR
        module consists of 3 components</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Laser</p></li>
        <li><p>Scanner</p></li>
        <li><p>GPS Module</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are several variants of Lidar, the two most popular being
        Topographic and Bathymetric.Topographic LiDAR consists of light with
        wavelengths near the infrared spectrum, while Bathymetric uses green
        light, which has the property to penetrate water columns.<span
        class="citation" data-cites="noaaWhatLidar"></span></p>
        <h2 id="how-does-lidar-work">How does LiDAR work?</h2>
        <p><img src="images/lidar-glossary.jpeg" style="width:100.0%"
        alt="image" /> <span id="fig:1.1" label="fig:1.1"></span></p>
        <p>LiDAR works by firing a pulse of light outward and timing the time
        taken for the light wave to be reflected back to the sensor. From this,
        we can find out the distance of objects from the sensor by using the
        formula <span class="math inline">v = d/t</span> (as we know
        the velocity of the wave and the time taken, we can calculate distance
        from the re-arrangement <span
        class="math inline"><em>d</em> = <em>v</em><em>t</em></span>)<span
        class="citation" data-cites="synopsysWhatLiDAR"></span>. By doing this
        100,000s per second, points can be placed on a 3D map with respect to
        the sensor<span class="citation"
        data-cites="mrlcgLiDARCars"></span>.</p>
        <h2 id="the-integration-to-autonomous-personal-vehicles">The integration
        to Autonomous Personal Vehicles</h2>
        <p><img
        src="images/optimus-rides-autonomous-self-driving-vehicles-are-equipped-news-photo-1619210210.jpeg"
        style="width:100.0%" alt="image" /> <span id="fig:1.1"
        label="fig:1.1"></span></p>
        <p>On Autonomous vehicles, a LiDAR system(LiDAR laser, receiver, and GPS
        module) is placed on the car(usually on the top) to provide a 360<span
        class="math inline"><sup><em>o</em></sup></span> view of the
        surroundings. The LiDAR module fires 100,000s of laser bursts per
        second<span class="citation" data-cites="rgbsiWhatLiDAR"></span>. Figure
        1.2 shows how this data looks in 3D space through the rendering of these
        points. This allows the car create a digital, mathematical environment
        in which algorithms can be written to find obstacles<span
        class="citation" data-cites="mrlcgLiDARCars"></span>.</p>
        <h1 id="effectiveness">Effectiveness</h1>
        <p>LiDAR is an effective sensor with almost no limitations other than
        its cost. However, LiDAR cannot work in heavy rain as the water droplets
        results in large diffraction of light, which makes it harder for the
        system to trace back the light point to the reflected object.
        Furthermore, the computational requirements needed for the processing of
        the data is quite immense. However, overall, LiDAR is an effective
        technology that works well<span class="citation"
        data-cites="synopsysWhatLiDAR"></span>.</p>
        <h1 id="implications">Implications</h1>
        <h2 id="social">Social</h2>
        <h2 id="positive">Positive</h2>
        <p>LiDAR based Autonomous Vehicles improve safety of commuters on the
        roads, which is done by the level of attentiveness and accuracy a
        computerized system is expected to have. With this system, crashes will
        become less frequent, as studies state that crashes would decrease from
        a lower estimate of 33% up to 90%. Taking into account that 1.35 million
        people died worldwide in 2016 from motor vehicular incidents, AVs would
        save a significant portion of people<span class="citation"
        data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>.</p>
        <p>Accessibility will also be increased, with elderly, physically or
        mentally challenged persons, or any other people that are unable to get
        qualification for driving will be able to use the roads safely to
        commute<span class="citation"
        data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>. This can connect them to
        services and family members that live further away and require commute
        by vehicle<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
        <h3 id="negative">Negative</h3>
        <p>However, Autonomous Vehicles have the potential to cause damage to
        the lives of the populace as well. For instance, they remove jobs from a
        significant portion of the population(which are automobile drivers). In
        the US, 2.9% of the population is engaged in these jobs, amounting to
        more than 4 million in total<span class="citation"
        data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>. As a result, the widespread
        introduction of AVs would result in mass job displacement in the sector,
        resulting in a surge in unemployment rates.</p>
        <h2 id="economic">Economic</h2>
        <h3 id="positive-1">Positive</h3>
        <p>LiDAR based autonomous vehicles decrease travel time significantly,
        as autonomous vehicles use smarter computer-based algorithms to manage
        traffic, while also following all rules set to minimize traffic at
        hotspots such as junctions. This is a prominent issue, as a study shows
        that Americans spend an average of 97 hours a year or  2.5 work weeks
        per year in traffic congestion. By reducing travel times, employees at
        companies will be more productive by a factor of effectively adding 2.5
        week’s worth of work per year on existing employee performance. This is
        show through data as well, as the cost of these congestions amounted to
        around $87 billion in 2018(as calculated by Forbes)<span
        class="citation" data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>.</p>
        <p>In the future, a fully autonomous truck fleet an posses significant
        economic benefits. This is caused by the fact that autonomous vehicles
        can decrease human labour, making it cheaper for employers while also
        not requiring mandatory breaks required for human truckers. AVs can also
        optimize routes to better save fuel, decreasing the cost per mile of
        cargo transport. To back this up with data, in a study researchers
        estimate that the Swedish Logistics sector can benefit with upto
        $1,215,292,000 USD in savings between 2020 and 2030 through the use of
        AVs<span class="citation" data-cites="divaportal"></span>.</p>
        <h3 id="negatives">Negatives</h3>
        <p>However, Autonomous Vehicles have the potential to economic damage as
        well. For instance, they remove jobs from a significant portion of the
        population(which are automobile drivers). In the US, 2.9% of the
        population is engaged in these jobs, amounting to more than 4 million in
        total. They earn a salary of approximately $45,000 dollars a year,
        resulting in a total of $180 billion per year in lost income<span
        class="citation" data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>. This can
        lead to significant cuts in spending of these now unemployed workers,
        resulting in hits to several different industries in terms of profit.
        Furthermore, AVs also reduce the number of crashes that occur
        significantly, which results in a large impact on the automobile repair
        industry. The automobile repair industry in the US accounts for over $71
        billion dollars in revenue. As AVs are expected to reduce the crash
        rates by between 33-90%, this can lead to losses in multi-billion dollar
        figures to the sector<span class="citation"
        data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>.</p>
        <p>LiDAR is also quite expensive, with a system needed for autonomous
        vehicles costing tens of thousands of dollars. For example,
        Velodyne-64’s LiDAR system costs around $80,000 USD, making it as
        expensive as a lot of Luxury cars<span class="citation"
        data-cites="neuvitionLiDARPriceCars"></span>. This logically drives the
        cost of AVs higher, significantly decreasing the potential market and
        cost of produces<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
        <h2 id="ethical">Ethical</h2>
        <p>Autonomous Vehicles also have ethical implications in several
        scenarios on the road<span class="citation"
        data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>. For instance, the AV may be
        hurtling towards a child and its too late to stop. However, there is
        traffic on the other lane. So, the scenario is for the computer to
        choose whether to kill the child or risk getting the owner getting
        injured in traffic. Such ethical dilemmas pose significant challenges to
        computerized vehicles and need to be regulated to ensure safety on
        roads.</p>
        <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
        <p>In conclusion, LiDAR proves itself a important part of any future
        autonomous vehicles, as it provides sensoral data on the distance of
        objects from the sensor. However there are some implications regarding
        Social, Ethical, and Economic factors.</p>
        <p>LiDAR is expensive and computationally heavy, but I believe that it
        will prove itself to be crucial to any future production autonomous
        vehicles due to its accuracy, distance, and weather-resistance.
        Furthermore, work is being done on LiDAR sensors to decrease the cost of
        LiDAR to between 500-1000 USD. Combining all of this, I think that LiDAR
        based Autonomous Vehicles is the future of transport.</p>
