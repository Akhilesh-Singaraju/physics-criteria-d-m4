                    <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has emerged as a
                        critical sensoral component in the production of autonomous vehicle
                        perception and navigation systems. LiDAR works by utilizing pulses of
                        electromagnetic waves to gather vital data on the distance from the
                        sensoral component and nearby objects. This research aims to
                        comprehensively evaluate the implications of LiDAR technology for
                        autonomous 4-wheeler driving. By analyzing the technical capabilities
                        and limitations of various LiDAR systems through conducting an effective
                        meta-analysis, this study analyses the potential implications of this
                        technology and autonomous vehicles in general. Additionally, the
                        computational demands, software algorithms, and infrastructure
                        requirements for processing large LiDAR datasets in real-time are
                        investigated. This work also examines the safety implications of LiDAR
                        and Autonomous Vehicles, including potential failures, sensor redundancy
                        needs, and verification and validation processes. The long-term
                        scalability and cost factors that may impact mainstream LiDAR adoption
                        are also taken into account. Overall, this multifaceted research aims to
                        provide a comprehensive perspective on the current state and future
                        prospects of LiDAR technology for enabling safe and reliable autonomous
                        driving capabilities.</p>
                    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Autonomous Vehicles(which is frequently refered to as "AV" or "AVs"
                        further throughout in this article) have been subject to multi-faceted
                        research fronts, with a sharp rise in the intensity of research on the
                        topic in recent years. AVs promise to revolutionize personalized
                        transport through safer, cleaner, more convenient mode of
                        transportation. However, a essential component of AVs needs to be
                        created and tested in real-world scenarios before production, which is
                        the distance sensor system. This is crucial in AVs as they allow the
                        computer to gauge the distance from surrounding traffic, pedestrians,
                        and understand lane zoning of roads, etc. A potential solution, which
                        will be covered in this article, is LiDAR, also known as Light Detection
                        and ranging. LiDAR uses electromagnetic waves to guage distances with
                        exceptional accuracy and in multiple weather conditions<span class="citation"
                            data-cites="synopsysWhatLiDAR mrlcgLiDARCars"></span>.</p>
                    <p>However, LiDAR is not the only solution to this problem. Some of
                        these are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Advanced Camera Systems. These systems use cameras and computer
                                vision algorithms for object recognition. However, these suffer in poor
                                lighting conditions<span class="citation" data-cites="dorlecoBestSensors"></span>.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Radar. Radar is a similar system that gives the direction of
                                movement and location of a object. However, it does provide as much
                                accuracy as LiDAR<span class="citation" data-cites="dorlecoBestSensors"></span>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Hybrid. Hybrid systems use a mix of LiDAR, Cameras, and Radar to
                                create a more accurate picture and provide more details basing of the
                                use cases of each. However, such systems would prove to be quite
                                expensive.</p>

                    <p>LiDAR Based Autonomous vehicles are connected to the statement of
                        inquiry "Wave theory demonstrates the interaction of energy with the
                        environment through modelling a law of the natural world", as LiDAR
                        works on the principles of wave-theory. LiDAR based Autonomous Vehicles
                        use wave theory, as it utilizes the reflection of light waves to measure
                        distance of an object from the sensor.</p>
                    <h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
                    <p>LiDAR(short for Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing
                        method that utilizes electromagnetic pulses to calculate the
                        ranges(variable distance from the device). Usually, this is paired with
                        other data to create a accurate 3D model of the environment. A LiDAR
                        module consists of 3 components</p>

                    <p>There are several variants of Lidar, the two most popular being
                        Topographic and Bathymetric.Topographic LiDAR consists of light with
                        wavelengths near the infrared spectrum, while Bathymetric uses green
                        light, which has the property to penetrate water columns.<span class="citation"

                    <p>LiDAR works by firing a pulse of light outward and timing the time
                        taken for the light wave to be reflected back to the sensor. From this,
                        we can find out the distance of objects from the sensor by using the
                        formula <span class="math inline">v = d/t</span> (as we know
                        the velocity of the wave and the time taken, we can calculate distance

                    <p>On Autonomous vehicles, a LiDAR system(LiDAR laser, receiver, and GPS
                        module) is placed on the car(usually on the top) to provide a 360<span

                    <h1 id="effectiveness">Effectiveness</h1>
                    <p>LiDAR is an effective sensor with almost no limitations other than
                        its cost. However, LiDAR cannot work in heavy rain as the water droplets
                        results in large diffraction of light, which makes it harder for the
                        system to trace back the light point to the reflected object.
                        Furthermore, the computational requirements needed for the processing of
                        the data is quite immense. However, overall, LiDAR is an effective
                        technology that works well<span class="citation" data-cites="synopsysWhatLiDAR"></span>.</p>

                    <p>LiDAR based Autonomous Vehicles improve safety of commuters on the
                        roads, which is done by the level of attentiveness and accuracy a
                        computerized system is expected to have. With this system, crashes will
                        become less frequent, as studies state that crashes would decrease from
                        a lower estimate of 33% up to 90%. Taking into account that 1.35 million
                        people died worldwide in 2016 from motor vehicular incidents, AVs would
                        save a significant portion of people<span class="citation"

                        the lives of the populace as well. For instance, they remove jobs from a
                        significant portion of the population(which are automobile drivers). In
                        the US, 2.9% of the population is engaged in these jobs, amounting to
                        more than 4 million in total<span class="citation" data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>.
                        As a result,
                        the widespread
                        introduction of AVs would result in mass job displacement in the sector,
                        resulting in a surge in unemployment rates.</p>
                    <h2 id="economic">Economic</h2>
                    <h3 id="positive-1">Positive</h3>
                    <p>LiDAR based autonomous vehicles decrease travel time significantly,
                        as autonomous vehicles use smarter computer-based algorithms to manage
                        traffic, while also following all rules set to minimize traffic at
                        hotspots such as junctions. This is a prominent issue, as a study shows
                        that Americans spend an average of 97 hours a year or  2.5 work weeks
                        per year in traffic congestion. By reducing travel times, employees at
                        companies will be more productive by a factor of effectively adding 2.5
                        week’s worth of work per year on existing employee performance. This is
                        show through data as well, as the cost of these congestions amounted to
                        around $87 billion in 2018(as calculated by Forbes)<span class="citation"
                            data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>.</p>
                    <p>In the future, a fully autonomous truck fleet an posses significant
                        economic benefits. This is caused by the fact that autonomous vehicles
                        can decrease human labour, making it cheaper for employers while also
                        not requiring mandatory breaks required for human truckers. AVs can also
                        optimize routes to better save fuel, decreasing the cost per mile of
                        cargo transport. To back this up with data, in a study researchers
                        estimate that the Swedish Logistics sector can benefit with upto
                        $1,215,292,000 USD in savings between 2020 and 2030 through the use of
                        AVs<span class="citation" data-cites="divaportal"></span>.</p>

                        total. They earn a salary of approximately $45,000 dollars a year,
                        resulting in a total of $180 billion per year in lost income<span class="citation"
                            data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>. This can
                        lead to significant cuts in spending of these now unemployed workers,
                        resulting in hits to several different industries in terms of profit.
                        Furthermore, AVs also reduce the number of crashes that occur
                        significantly, which results in a large impact on the automobile repair
                        industry. The automobile repair industry in the US accounts for over $71
                        billion dollars in revenue. As AVs are expected to reduce the crash
                        rates by between 33-90%, this can lead to losses in multi-billion dollar
                        figures to the sector<span class="citation" data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>.</p>
                    <p>LiDAR is also quite expensive, with a system needed for autonomous
                        vehicles costing tens of thousands of dollars. For example,
                        Velodyne-64’s LiDAR system costs around $80,000 USD, making it as
                        expensive as a lot of Luxury cars<span class="citation"
                            data-cites="neuvitionLiDARPriceCars"></span>. This
                        logically drives the
                        cost of AVs higher, significantly decreasing the potential market and
                        cost of produces<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"

                    <h2 id="ethical">Ethical</h2>
                    <p>Autonomous Vehicles also have ethical implications in several
                        scenarios on the road<span class="citation" data-cites="compactEconomicSocial"></span>. For
                        instance, the AV
                        may be
                        hurtling towards a child and its too late to stop. However, there is
                        traffic on the other lane. So, the scenario is for the computer to
                        choose whether to kill the child or risk getting the owner getting
                        injured in traffic. Such ethical dilemmas pose significant challenges to
                        computerized vehicles and need to be regulated to ensure safety on
                        roads.</p>
                    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>In conclusion, LiDAR proves itself a important part of any future
                        autonomous vehicles, as it provides sensoral data on the distance of
                        objects from the sensor. However there are some implications regarding
                        Social, Ethical, and Economic factors.</p>
                    <p>LiDAR is expensive and computationally heavy, but I believe that it
                        will prove itself to be crucial to any future production autonomous
                        vehicles due to its accuracy, distance, and weather-resistance.
                        Furthermore, work is being done on LiDAR sensors to decrease the cost of
                        LiDAR to between 500-1000 USD. Combining all of this, I think that LiDAR
                        based Autonomous Vehicles is the future of transport.</p>
